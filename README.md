### Songbird
"Songbird" is a web application that allows users to guess which sound is made by what bird using the Audio API. <br/>
The application presents the user with a series of bird sounds and corresponding images, <br/>
and the user must match the correct sound to the correct bird image. <br/>
The user can listen to the sounds and choose their answer by clicking on the corresponding bird image. <br/>
The application tracks the user's score and provides feedback after each guess. <br/>
The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes the Audio API to play the bird sounds.
